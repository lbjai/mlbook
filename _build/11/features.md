# Features

This is a short demonstration textbook to show the general layout / style of textbooks built
with Jupyter and Jekyll. The markdown files for *this* page (and others in the textbook) is generated from the notebooks
with the `scripts/generate_textbook.py` script, which is called when you run `make book`.

The content for the book is contained in a folder in the site's repository called `content/`. It has a
combination of markdown and Jupyter notebooks. This content is rendered into the textbook that you see here!

To begin, click on one of the chapter sections in the sidebar to the left. The first section demonstrates some
simple functionality of this repository, while the following chapters contain a subset of content from the
[Foundations in Data Science](https://inferentialthinking.com).

## Quickstart

This chapter shows a couple ways to add content to your course textbook. Click on the section headers
to the left, or on the "next" button below in order to read further.
